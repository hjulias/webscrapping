This project is about automatizing monthly routines, mainly the Download and Rename files. The webscrapping code available in 'code.py' file makes the process easier and faster for all users, requiring only a few adjustments by the user:

---------------- Importing Libraries
To install libraries, perform the following lines of code in "Terminal" (if using Pycharm).

> pip install selenium
> pip install pandas
> pip install holidays

---------------- Initializing Chrome Webdriver
You should pass your computer's path to 'options.binary_location' (Google Chrome path) and 'chrome_driver_binary' (Chrome WebDriver path).

If you don't have a Chrome WebDriver installed or it is outdated, access: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
